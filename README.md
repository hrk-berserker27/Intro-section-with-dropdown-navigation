![Design preview for the Intro section with dropdown navigation coding challenge](./Intro-section-with-dropdown-menu.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution for the Intro section with dropdown navigation coding challenge on [Fronend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
**Requirements for completing this challenge: HTML, CSS, JS**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
My users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Time taken to complete this project

This project took over 5 hours of work.

## Learnings from this project

- Time management is an issue which needs to be looked at in futute projects.
- Learned how to use GitHub Actions to create workflows.
- How to deploy static sites build using NextJS on GitHub.
- Revised important topics related to NextJS such as adding Head component and static generation(HTML is generated at build time and  
  reused on each request) of pages.
- Never giving up worked as I kept trying different ways to solve issues faced during styling and adding hover effects.

## Where was I stuck during this project?

- Styling the mobile layout was hectic as I had chosen to design the desktop layout first which delayed the completion.
- Lot of issues faced during deployment but it was my first time doing it so it can be forgiven.
- Trying to make projects as perfect to provided design also led to dalay.(no objections)
